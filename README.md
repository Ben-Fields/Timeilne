### Running
Run the `index.html` file directly to use the application.

### Contributing
The web app is developed natively in HTML, JS, and CSS. 

Only edit stylesheets in the `scss/` folder.
SCSS is a superset of CSS, so you can opt to use the features of SCSS or use 
plain CSS. [Download the SCSS compiler](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/latest), 
and run `sass --watch scss:css` from the command line to automatically save changes.
