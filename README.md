## About

### Description

This is a web app for creating interactive timelines and publishing them 
to the web.

<br />

## Development

### Making Changes

The web app is developed natively in HTML, JS, and CSS. 

Edit stylesheets in the `scss/` folder.
SCSS is a superset of CSS, so you can opt to use its additional features or use plain CSS. 
[Download the SCSS compiler](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/latest), 
and run `sass --watch scss:css` from the command line to automatically save changes.
